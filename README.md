 A practical introduction to machine learning and natural language processing on papyrus data


## Agenda
Introduction slides: ADD LINK HERE



## Session 1 (45 minutes): 
- Setup of google colab to run the workshop material
- Explore the papyrus dataset that will be used in the workshop
- Use python and jupyter notebooks to explore and preprocess the data, for example by cleaning, filtering and transforming the data.
- Show how to use various python libraries, such as pandas, for working with the text data
- Hands-on excercise: Cleaning and filtering of dataset

## Session 2 (45 minutes)
- Introduce the basics of natural language processing, such as tokenization, stemming, stopword removal.
- Show how these techniques can be applied to natural language processing data using libraries like NLTK.
- Hands-on excercise: Apply NLP techniques to dataset.

## Session 3 (45 minutes)
- Introduction to basic machine learning techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Show how to build a text classification model with our dataset, using sci-kit learn and pandas.
- Hands-on exercise: Build and train your own classification model using the papyrus dataset.
- Wrap up: Recap of main points and key takeaways from the workshop
- Q&A


BONUS: How to deploy your application using Gradio.
